/*
Table: Logs

+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| num         | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
id is an autoincrement column.
 

Write an SQL query to find all numbers that appear at least three times consecutively.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

 

Example 1:

Input: 
Logs table:
+----+-----+
| id | num |
+----+-----+
| 1  | 1   |
| 2  | 1   |
| 3  | 1   |
| 4  | 2   |
| 5  | 1   |
| 6  | 2   |
| 7  | 2   |
+----+-----+
Output: 
+-----------------+
| ConsecutiveNums |
+-----------------+
| 1               |
+-----------------+
Explanation: 1 is the only number that appears consecutively for at least three times.
*/


-- SOLUTION 

/* Write your T-SQL query statement below */
SELECT DISTINCT out.num as ConsecutiveNums 
FROM (SELECT id, num, 
LAG(num, 1) OVER (order BY id) as lag1, 
LAG(num, 2) OVER (order BY id) as lag2
FROM Logs) out
WHERE 
out.num = out.lag1 AND
out.lag1 = out.lag2
